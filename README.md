The inspiration for this project was my frustration with not knowing how far I was from achieving Queen Bee in NYT's Spelling Bee. 
I began this project with the goal of displaying all possible words for a given Spelling Bee game. I then generalized my solver to
also function as a Wordle Solver. Stay tuned for an even more general algorithm for finding words quickly and a clean UI ;)
